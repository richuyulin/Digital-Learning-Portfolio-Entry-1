## Personal goals for Chinese this semester

My personal goal for Chinese this semester is to learn more Chinese characters. This would allow me to better communicate with my grandparents through text and decrease the need to use the google translate speak out loud feature. I would also like to practice writing more Chinese characters. For me, there's a difference between being able to recognize characters and being able to handwrite the character without reference. So I'm hoping I'll have some opportunity to practice handwriting Chinese and reach a level beyond recognition for Chinese characters. In terms of pronunciation for Chinese, get better at distinguishing between h and no h sound in ch, sh, and zh sounds.
