## Personal goals for Chinese this semester

My personal goal for Chinese this semester is to learn more Chinese characters. This would allow me to better communicate with my grandparents through text and decrease the need to use the google translate speak out loud feature. I would also like to practice writing more Chinese characters. For me, there's a difference between being able to recognize characters and being able to handwrite the character without reference. So I'm hoping I'll have some opportunity to practice handwriting Chinese and reach a level beyond recognition for Chinese characters. In terms of pronunciation for Chinese, get better at distinguishing between h and no h sound in ch, sh, and zh sounds.

## Did you know your language learning style before taking this questionaire?
I would say I have a sense of my language learning style before taking this questionnaire. This is because I was exposed to many languages growing up and forced to learn them without much success. I find it difficult to hear a phrase and can't pair it with any characters or words. This is because written stuff helps with my memory. So Fujianese dialect, for example, was very difficult for me to understand because there weren't a separate set of characters to match, and I already associated Chinese simplified characters with mandarin. I also find I learn more by using rather than memorizing. So I force myself to jump into French communities on Discord and just practice and allow others to correct me. 

## Were the results accurate? Please elaborate (e.g. what results were accurate, what are not).
### Language Learning Attitude

I feel like the results were pretty accurate. I struggle with GAD (general anxiety discord), so naturally, I would prefer anything that's low anxiety and risk-averse. I have been put down by my parents so many times, to the point in which I don't really care about my self-image and ego. I generally spend more time learning things I'm motivated or captivated by a sense of desire to find out the unknown.

### Brain Dominance

I feel like this is accurate. I've always known that I'm logical/analytical (left brain) with a touch of creativity in arts (right side).

### Meyers-Briggs

I feel like this is accurate. I see myself as such, plus I did a similar test a while back on my personality and came out with the same result. 

## Have you used Quizlet and Wechat before? If you have, for what purpose? How often do you use it?

I have used Quizlet before, but that was a while ago. I only use Quizlet to do practice questions for upcoming assessments if others have already created practice flashcards. I don't find flashcards particularly helpful for me, so I end up not spending any time making them. But I think flashcards are a good way to quiz yourself and see what you don't know right before an actual assessment. 

I have used WeChat before, have been since like 2011 or 2012. I'm personally not a fan of WeChat because the Chinese government is always monitoring every message sent there. But I use it to keep in touch with my relatives in China, so I check it every week. More frequently if I know there's something important unfolding.
